# Introduction #

Who is here?  Who wants to work on what?

Fill in your interest below.  For "Area of interest", the options are:
  * Drive system
  * Autonomous
  * Visual tracking
  * Mechanisms (arm, elevator, claw, kicker, etc.)
  * Diagnostics on robot (Limit switches, Jaguar state, motor speed, encoder positions, etc.)
  * Diagnostics in dashboard (network protocol, etc.)
  * User interface design (dashboard, operator control, Kinect)
  * Kinect implementation (works within dashboard)
  * General dashboard GUI implementation
  * Simulator
  * Mentor

With the size of our team, we probably want two or three people to work together in any one area. To work well, we'll need each sub-team to have at least one laptop and at least one member with prior programming experience.
