Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/theforceteam-1073

Before GitHub, FIRST Team 1073 used the now discontinued Google Code. This is the original archive of the 2011 Robot Elot.
This code probably exists on this account in the form of many forks.

The difference between this repository and the forks is that if you `git log` this repo you will see the Mercurial commits from the original run. This was thanks to an exporter google provided before they tore down their open source hosting.
